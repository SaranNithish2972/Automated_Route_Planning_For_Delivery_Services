# Automated_Route_Planning_For_Delivery_Services
The project addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using Dijkstra's algorithm and backtracking. It optimizes routes for efficient delivery by considering factors like distance, vehicle capacities, and delivery demands. Through a graph representation of the delivery network, it computes shortest distances and assigns deliveries intelligently. The resulting routes are visualized on a map for easy interpretation. This approach enhances resource utilization, leading to cost savings and improved service efficiency for businesses.
